# react-parcel-bare
A bare-bones React project base, created as a lightweight alternative to CRA (`create-react-app`). It may be used as a foundation to build or test simple React code that uses Parcel to bundle and serve it. This project base supports watching for changes and hot reloading due to in-built functionalities in Parcel.  However, unlike CRA, this project is minimalistic and doesn't come with the extra configurations that support unit testing, etc. It is good for learners who only need to focus on basic React and Parcel.
